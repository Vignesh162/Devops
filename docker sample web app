To build a Docker image for a simple HTML web application, follow these steps. The application will serve a static HTML file using a lightweight web server like Nginx or Apache inside a Docker container.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Create the HTML Web Application

Start by creating a basic HTML file for the web application.

- Create a project folder called `simple-web-app`.
- Inside this folder, create an `index.html` file.

Hereâ€™s an example of `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple Web App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Simple Web Application</h1>
    <p>This is a basic HTML page served from a Docker container.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### 2. Create a `Dockerfile`

Next, create a `Dockerfile` in the `simple-web-app` directory. This file contains the instructions for Docker to build the image.

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Nginx image as the base image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the HTML file to the Nginx default html location
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Expose port 80 to allow external traffic
EXPOSE 80
```

#### 3. Build the Docker Image

Now that you have the HTML file and the `Dockerfile`, open a terminal and navigate to the `simple-web-app` directory. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t simple-web-app .
```

This command will build the image and tag it as `simple-web-app`.

#### 4. Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 simple-web-app
```

This will run the container in detached mode and map port 8080 on your local machine to port 80 in the container, where Nginx is serving the HTML file.

#### 5. Access the Web Application

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the simple HTML web page with the message:

```
Welcome to My Simple Web Application
This is a basic HTML page served from a Docker container.
```

### Summary

You now have a Docker container running a simple HTML web application. The Dockerfile uses the official Nginx image, copies the HTML file into the correct directory, and exposes port 80 for the web server.

### Files Overview:
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML content.
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building the Docker image.

You can now build and deploy similar applications with ease!
